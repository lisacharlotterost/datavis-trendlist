# Twitter Bot @studyknowact

>Study, Know, Act, Win. (Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Brazil)


[Bot](https://twitter.com/studyknowact) that tweets mottos from universities, military, nations, states, cities, brands. 

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_mottos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_mottos)


### How did I do it? 

1. Copy and paste the Twitter mottos into a spreadsheet
2. Follow [this](http://www.storybench.org/build-google-spreadsheet-auto-tweets-archives/) Tutorial
3. Heck yeah.



### In this folder, you can find 

- the AI file that’s used to make the Logo for the bot
- the CSV file that contains ALL the mottos from many of the Wikipedia pages, with the following columns: 
— organisation
— category 
— location
— motto
— full tweet


What could be improved? 

Originally, I wanted to do a bot that tweets mottos JUST by universities and military organisations, alternating.

I decided to not do that because a) it seemed technologically difficult, and b) because my tweets would have come to an end soonish.
